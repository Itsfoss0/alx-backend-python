## About
Python variable annotation, also known as type hinting, is a feature introduced in Python 3.5 that allows you to provide type information for variables, function arguments, and return values. It helps improve code readability, enables static type checkers, and provides better IDE support

## Concepts
For this project, you are expected to look at the following concepts
- [Advanced Python](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/554)

## Resources
__Read or Watch__:
1. [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
2. [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Learning objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), __without the help of Google__:
 - [X] Type annotations in Python 3
 - [X] How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
 - [X] Duck typing
 - [X] How to validate your code with `mypy`
