## Asynchronous Genrators
Asynchronous generators are a powerful feature introduced in Python 3.6 that combine the capabilities of asynchronous programming and generators. They allow you to create functions that can produce a sequence of values asynchronously.

## Resources
__Read or watch__:

1. [PEP 530 – Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0530/)
2. [What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2017/02/14/whats-new-in-python-asynchronous-comprehensions-generators/)
3. [Type-hints for generators](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42531143/how-to-type-hint-a-generator-in-python-3)

## Learning objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), __without the help of Google__:

- [ ] How to write an asynchronous generator
- [ ] How to use async comprehensions
- [ ] How to type-annotate generators
